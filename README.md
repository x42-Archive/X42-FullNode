x42
===============

http://www.x42.tech
A blockchain for entrepreneurs
----------------------------

x42 is an implementation of the Bitcoin protocol in C# on the [.NET Core](https://dotnet.github.io/) platform.  
The node can run on the Bitcoin and x42 networks.  
x42 Bitcoin is based on the [NBitcoin](https://github.com/MetacoSA/NBitcoin) project.  

For Proof of Stake support on the x42 token the node is using [NStratis](https://github.com/stratisproject/NStratis) which is a POS implementation of NBitcoin.  

[.NET Core](https://dotnet.github.io/) is an open source cross platform framework and enables the development of applications and services on Windows, macOS and Linux.

The design
----------

**A Modular Approach**

A Blockchain is made of many components, from a FullNode that validates blocks to a Simple Wallet that track addresses.
The end goal is to develop a set of [Nuget](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NuGet) packages from which an implementer can cherry pick what he needs.

* **NBitcoin**
* **x42.Bitcoin.Core**  - The bare minimum to run a pruned node.
* **x42.Bitcoin.Store** - Store and relay blocks to peers.
* **x42.Bitcoin.MemoryPool** - Track pending transaction.
* **x42.Bitcoin.Wallet** - Send and Receive coins
* **x42.Bitcoin.Miner** - POS or POW
* **x42.Bitcoin.Explorer**


Create a Blockchain in a .NET Core style programming
```
  var node = new FullNodeBuilder()
   .UseNodeSettings(nodeSettings)
   .UseConsensus()
   .UseBlockStore()
   .UseMempool()
   .AddMining()
   .AddRPC()
   .Build();

  node.Run();
```

Running a FullNode
------------------

The master branch is actively developed and regularly committed to, and it can become unstable.  
To compile a stable (production) release use any of the release tags form version 3.0.x.x and upwards.  

```
git clone https://github.com/x42protocol/X42-FullNode.git
cd X42-FullNode\src

dotnet build

```

To run on the Bitcoin network:
```
cd Stratis.BitcoinD
dotnet run
```  

To run on the x42 network:
```
cd x42.x42D
dotnet run
```

Testing
-------
* [Testing Guidelines](Documentation/testing-guidelines.md)

CI build
-----------

We use [AppVeyor](https://www.appveyor.com/) for our CI build and to create nuget packages.
Every time someone pushes to the master branch or create a pull request on it, a build is triggered and new nuget packages are created.

To skip a build, for example if you've made very minor changes, include the text **[skip ci]** or **[ci skip]** in your commits' comment (with the squared brackets).

If you want get the :sparkles: latest :sparkles: (and unstable :bomb:) version of the nuget packages here: 
* [x42.Bitcoin](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/x42/x42bitcoinfullnode/artifacts/nuget/x42.Bitcoin.1.0.7-alpha.nupkg?job=Configuration%3A%20Release)

Ubuntu 19+ issue
----------------

When running x42.x42D on Ubuntu 19+, you'll get an error, because of library version mismatch.
This seems to be a compatibility problem with dotnet2.0 and the later Ubuntu versions.
The workaround for this problem is to manually download the libssl1.0, and point the lib directory before running x42.x42D

You can download libssl1.0 from [here](http://packages.linuxmint.com/pool/upstream/o/openssl/libssl1.0.0_1.0.1j-1_amd64.deb).
After that, extract (not install) the package, and point the location:

```bash
cd /home/user/Download
ar x libssl1.0.0_1.0.1j-1_amd64.deb
tar xf data.tar.xz
```
Now you can move the lib directory somewhere more convenient:
```bash
mv usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu ~/.local/lib/libssl1.0
```
And start the daemon:
```bash
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/user/.local/lib/libssl1.0 /opt/x42\ Core/resources/daemon/x42.x42D
```
Now you should have the x42 daemon running.
